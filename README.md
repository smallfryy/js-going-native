# js-going-native üëπ
Hello, world! I'm building a lightbox photo library in native JavaScript using the Flickr API. No JQuery or JavaScript frameworks here. üôÖ

## Description 
So, why no JQuery? üò± In this exercise I'm going under the hood of AJAX requests in raw JavaScript. This is a great opportunity to consider whether using JQuery is necessary in client-side js applications, because -- hello! -- dependencies increase application load on the client-side. As engineers, we want to build lean yet robust applications for enjoyable end-user experiences. üòé This exercise was a fun way to cement my understanding of using raw javascript to make API queries, altogther freeing myself from the ball-and-chain that is $(document).ready()[....].

## Content 
Since Northwest Coast Native art is my jam -- and since I've spent a lot of time studying these objects and their interpretations in museum settings -- I've decided to render a photo library of Northwest Coast Native Art. Behold: Bill Reid. 

## Technologies Used
- Flickr API 
- JavaScript in the raw üêü 

## User Experience - Method
- Typically, when I approach a problem, I think about code from frontend (UX) to backend. This is usually when I perform a hypoethical/imaginary "ethnography" of my end user and ask myself: 1) what does the user want to see?; 2) how can the user interact with my application; 3) what features in my application can epower the user with impactful intractive experiences? 

## User Experience - Practice
1. User arrives at a page and sees a 4x4 grid of photo images.  
1a. These image thumbnails are popualted via Flikr API.
2. User selects an image and sees it expand, lightbox-style, while other images dim in the background. 
3. User navigates through photo library (next/previous photos). Photos must display corresponding photo tile. 
4. User minimizes photo to return to thumbnail gallery. 

## Cross-Browser View
- This should run on latest verison of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE: ‚úÖ

## A Note about Responsiveness
- CSS has been styled for two types of media formatting: screens of min-width : 720px and max-width: 720px. 

## Version II Wish List
- Integrate with Aframe or D3.js for unique front-end experience.
- API unit tests
- Tests in Selenium, Cucumber
- Cross-browser responsiveness 
- Allowing users to naviagte through images on multiple devices (nexus, iphone, ipad) while maintaining DOM integrity.

## Blogging 
- I plan to write about my experiences with this project on my blog: blog.holly-peck.com.

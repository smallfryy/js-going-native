# js-going-native
A native JavaScript application to query photos with Flickr API.

# description
In this project I will learn what's "under the hood" of AJAX Requests with JQuery/JS libraries. I will not be using any libraries or frameworks other than raw JavaScript. This is a great chance to think about whether using JQuery is necessary in client-side js applications. 

# technologies used
- JavaScript
- Furtive.io
- Flickr API
